Use a single array to implement three separate stacks.
Design and implement a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min which returns the minimum element. Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.
Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
